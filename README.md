# Ray Casting
## Description
Ray Casting is a cgi rendering technique to create high quality, realistic images via computing the path of individual light rays from the Camera to the light (false direction) or vice versa (true direction). This project provides a basic Java based implementation of this. It also is capable of reading a scene from a yaml file and rendering it without needing someone to actually having to write any Code.
## Usage
If you just want to use this as a renderer you only need to execute the SceneParser class. Either way you might want to take a look at [this](https://github.com/Severin-Nitsche/Ray-Casting/wiki/Getting_Started) wiki page on getting started. If you like to render other scenes than the example feel free to take a look at the `example.yaml` file inside `the res/scenes` directory or visit [this](https://github.com/Severin-Nitsche/Ray-Casting/wiki/Scenes) wiki site on how to render your own scene.
